# Odin-recipes


It is a simple html website

This was created after completing the introductory course for the odin project

There will be a main pages and three sub pages for three different ingredients:
Lasagna
Beef Soup
Aglio E olio: Easy meal to make and tastes pretty good

May add a meal for pancakes later
